# fennec
An Homebrew computer using the 65c02 CPU.

All assembly code is built using my custom assembler built for personal hobby use, [CapyAsm](https://github.com/smaldragon/CapyASM), these two projects are closely linked and build off eachother, *with both* currently being in a early alpha state subject to bugs and regular breaking changes.

Documentation for the machine is located on its wiki at https://fennec6502.miraheze.org/
